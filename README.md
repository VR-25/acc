#### DESCRIPTION

This is primarily intended for extending battery lifespan (or service life). On the flip side, it is a general purpose /sys interface manipulation utility (i.e., for setting voltage_max, CPU Governor, CPU scaling frequencies and more). It works with any root solution. Magisk 17.0+ is preferred. Versions below that are not supported.

By default, battery stats are automatically reset once battery capacity reaches the `maxCapacity %`. Users can choose whether battery stats are also reset every time the charger is unplugged (resetUnplugged=true/false). This is not guaranteed to work on all systems, though.

Depending on device's capabilities, charging can be controlled based on temperature conditions, battery capacity, time, voltage, current and/or more variables. Limiting the charging voltage (i.e., to no more than 4.2V) is the best thing to do for a long lasting battery service life. There's an option for that (misc settings). Unfortunately, not all devices/kernels allow modifying voltage_max (even with rw permissions). Fortunately, for those who are deprived of this ability, acc can keep battery voltage within less stressful thresholds -- and it does that by default. Read on...

Charging is paused when battery temperature >= `maxTemp °C` or capacity >= `maxCapacity %`.

To prevent deep battery discharges and eventual cell damage, system is automatically and cleanly shutdown if battery is not charging and its capacity <= `shutdownCapacity %`.

Changes to config take effect within `loopDelay` seconds). No reboot is necessary.

If config.txt is missing, it is automatically recreated with default settings. However if it is deliberately removed while acc daemon is running, accd crashes.

Daemon state is managed with `acc -D/--daemon <start/stop/restart>`. accd can as well be started/restarted by simply running `accd`. It can also be stopped through the removal of the lock file `/dev/acc/running`. This file  contains the daemon's Process ID (PID).

Logs are stored at `/data/media/0/acc/logs/`. `acc-debug-$deviceName.log` contains power supply information. That's were one would look for a charging switch when the device is not supported by acc. Some (very few) devices have charging switch(es) somewhere in /proc/ (e.g., /proc/smb1357_disable_chrg). Unfortunately, since /proc/ is non-standard for this sort of things, it's harder to look in there for charging switches. Most of the time, users will have to do that themselves. The remaining log files (`acc-daemon-$deviceName.log*`) contain runtime diagnostic information used for debugging general/advanced issues.

#### TERMINAL

`Usage: acc <options> <args>

-c/--config <editor [opts]>   Edit config w/ <editor [opts]> (default: vim/vi)
  e.g., acc -c nano -l

-d/--disable <#%, #s, #m or #h (optional)>   Disable charging or disable charging with <condition>
  e.g., acc -d 70% (do not recharge until capacity drops to 70%), acc -d 1h (do not recharge until 1 hour has passed)

-D/--daemon   Show current acc daemon (accd) state
  i.e., acc -D

-D/--daemon <start/stop/restart>   Manage accd state
  e.g., acc -D restart

-e/--enable <#%, #s, #m or #h (optional)>   Enable charging or enable charging with <condition>
  e.g., acc -e 30m (recharge for 30 minutes)

-i/--info   Show power supply info
  i.e., acc --info

-l/--log <editor [opts]>   Open <acc-daemon-deviceName.log> w/ <editor [opts]> (default: vim/vi)
  e.g., acc -l grep ': ' (show errors only), acc -l cat >/sdcard/acc.log (yes, this also works)

-r/--readme   Open <README.md> w/ <editor [opts]> (default: vim/vi)
  i.e., acc -r

-s/--set   Show current config
  i.e., acc --set

-s/--set <var> <value>   Set config parameters
  e.g., acc -s verbose true (enable verbose), acc -s capacity 5,60,80-85 (5: shutdown (default), 60: cool down (default), 80: resume, 85: pause)

-s/--set <resume-stop preset>   Can be 4041/endurance+, 5960/endurance, 7080/default, 8090/lite 9095/travel
  e.g., acc -s endurance+ (a.k.a, "the li-ion sweet spot"; best for GPS navigation and other long operations), acc -s travel (for when you need extra juice), acc -s 7080 (restore default capacity settings (5,60,70-80))

-s/--set <s/switch>   Set a different charging switch from the database
  i.e., acc -s s

Tips

  Pause and resume capacities can also be set with acc <pause%> <resume%>.
    e.g., acc 85 80

  Commands can be chained for extended functionality.
   acc -e 30m && acc -d 6h && acc -e 85 && accd (recharge for 30 minutes, halt charging for 6 hours, recharge to 85% capacity and restart daemon)`



#### DEFAULT CONFIG

`capacity=5,60,70-80 # <shutdown,coolDown,resume-pause> -- ideally, <resume> shouldn't be more than 10 units below <pause>. <shutdown> and <coolDown> can be null/disabled (i.e., capacity=,,70-80).

coolDown=50/10 # Charge/pause ratio (in seconds) -- reduces battery temperature and voltage induced stress by periodically pausing charging. This can be disabled with a null value or a preceding hashtag.

temp=400-450_90 # coolDown-pauseCharging_wait -- <wait> is interpreted in seconds and it allows battery temperature to drop below <pauseCharging>. By default, temperature values are interpreted in <degrees Celsius times 10>. If <coolDown> is null (i.e., temp=-450_90), the cooling engine acts upon coolDown capacity and max temperature only.

verbose=false # Alpha and Beta versions will generate verbose whether or not this is enabled.

resetUnplugged=false # Reset battery stats every time charger is unplugged, as opposed to only when max battery capacity is reached.

loopDelay=10 # Time interval between loops, in seconds -- do not change this unless you know exactly what you're doing!

maxLogSize=10 # Log size limit in Megabytes -- when exceeded, $log becomes $log.old. This prevents storage space hijacking.

switch= # Charging switch parameters (<path> <onValue> <offValue>), example: switch=/sys/class/power_supply/battery/charging_enabled 1 0, pro tip: <./> can be used in place of </sys/class/power_supply/> (i.e., switch=./battery/charging_enabled 1 0). NOTE: if acc's database contains a working charging switch for your device, it is set automatically when charger is connected for the first time after installing and rebooting.

misc=./usb/device/razer_charge_limit_enable:1 ./usb/device/razer_charge_limit_max:80 ./usb/device/razer_charge_limit_dropdown:70 # This can even be used for setting voltage_max (max charging voltage), CPU Governor, CPU scaling frequencies and pretty much anything else tweakable through the /sys interface. Note that the default working path is </sys/class/power_supply/> -- hence, <./> is also valid. These settings are applied on boot, after main() and before other function are called.

exitMisc=false # Exit after applying misc settings from above. Enabling this is particularly useful if voltage_max or similar is being set -- since keeping accd running in such cases is pointless.`

#### PRE-REQUISITES

- Any root solution, preferably Magisk 17.0+
- App to run (as root) `accd` or `/system/etc/acc/autorun.sh` or `acc -D start` on boot, if system doesn't support Magisk nor init.d
- Basic terminal usage knowledge
- Terminal Emulator (i.e., Termux)



---
#### SETUP STEPS

First time
1. Install from Magisk Manager or custom recovery.
2. Reboot
3. [Optional] customize /data/media/0/acc/config.txt.

Upgrade
1. Install from Magisk Manager or custom recovery.
2. Reboot

After ROM updates
- Unless `addon.d` feature is supported by the ROM, follow the upgrade steps above.

Uninstall
1. Magisk: use Magisk Manager or other tool; legacy: flashing the same version again removes all traces of acc from /system.
